In another bowl, whisk eggs, buttermilk, oil, and vanilla until combined. Slowly add wet ingredients to dry, mixing just until smooth. Stir in the hot coffee — the batter will be thin, but that’s perfect for a moist cake. Pour evenly into the pans and bake for 30–35 minutes until a toothpick comes out clean. Let cool 10 minutes, then remove from pans and cool completely.\n\nFor the ganache filling, heat cream and butter until steaming but not boiling. Pour over chopped chocolate and let sit 5 minutes. Stir until silky smooth. Chill slightly until spreadable.\n\nFor the truffle frosting, melt dark chocolate with cream and espresso powder, then beat in softened butter until glossy and thick. Refrigerate 20–30 minutes if too soft.\n\nTo assemble, place one cake layer on a board, spread a thick layer of ganache. Add the second layer, more ganache, then the third cake. Frost the entire cake with truffle frosting, smoothing the top and sides. Dust lightly with cocoa powder, decorate with chocolate curls, and chill 1 hour before serving.\n\nServe slices with whipped cream or fresh raspberries. Store covered in the fridge for up to 4 days."}
